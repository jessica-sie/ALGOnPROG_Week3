"""
An elementary school teacher has asked for your help in teaching their students about types of fractions,
as well as reducing (or simplifying) fractions.
The teacher also reminds you that a fraction cannot be reduced if the greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1;
if it is not 1, the gcd can be used to reduce the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator
by the gcd.

1) Ask the user to enter a numerator and denominator. Use input validation to ensure that both the numerator and
denominator are positive. (Note: 0 is not considered positive.)
2) Calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) using the gcd function from the math module. The function can be used as:
math.gcd(a,b) where a and b are the numerator and denominator respectively. Donâ€™t forget to include the math module!
